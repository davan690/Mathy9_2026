## Introduction

Algebra is the language of mathematics. It allows us to describe patterns, relationships, and solve problems using symbols and variables.

## Key Topics

### Variables and Expressions

Understanding algebraic notation:

- Variables represent unknown or changing values
- Writing algebraic expressions
- Evaluating expressions by substitution

**Example:** If $x = 5$, evaluate $3x + 7$

Solution: $3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22$

### Simplifying Expressions

Working with algebraic terms:

- Collecting like terms
- Expanding brackets
- Factorizing simple expressions

**Example:** Simplify $5x + 3 - 2x + 7$

Solution: $5x - 2x + 3 + 7 = 3x + 10$

### Solving Linear Equations

Finding unknown values:

- One-step equations
- Two-step equations
- Equations with brackets
- Equations with variables on both sides

**Example:** Solve $2x + 5 = 13$

Solution:
$$\begin{align}
2x + 5 &= 13 \\
2x &= 8 \\
x &= 4
\end{align}$$

### Patterns and Sequences

Recognizing and describing patterns:

- Number patterns
- Geometric patterns
- Finding the nth term
- Linear sequences

**Example:** Find the next term in the sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...

Solution: The pattern increases by 4 each time, so the next term is 19.

### Graphing Linear Relationships

Visualizing equations:

- Plotting points on a coordinate plane
- Drawing straight line graphs
- Understanding gradient (slope)
- Finding the equation of a line

**Example:** Graph the equation $y = 2x + 1$

## Practice Problems

1. Simplify: $4a + 3b - 2a + 5b$
2. Solve: $3x - 7 = 14$
3. Find the 10th term of the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...
4. Expand: $3(x + 4)$
