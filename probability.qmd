## Introduction

Probability is the study of chance and likelihood. It helps us predict and understand uncertain events in mathematics and everyday life.

## Key Topics

### Basic Probability Concepts

Understanding chance:

- Probability measures how likely an event is to occur
- Probability scale: 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)
- Expressing probability as fractions, decimals, and percentages

**Example:** The probability of rolling a 3 on a standard die is $\frac{1}{6}$

### Theoretical Probability

Calculating probability using logic:

- Formula: $P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$
- Sample space (all possible outcomes)
- Equally likely outcomes

**Example:** What is the probability of drawing a heart from a standard deck of 52 cards?

Solution: $P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%$

### Experimental Probability

Probability based on trials and experiments:

- Conducting experiments
- Recording results
- Calculating relative frequency
- Comparing theoretical and experimental probability

**Example:** If you flip a coin 50 times and get 28 heads, the experimental probability is $\frac{28}{50} = 0.56$

### Probability Language

Describing likelihood:

- Impossible (probability = 0)
- Unlikely (probability between 0 and 0.5)
- Even chance (probability = 0.5)
- Likely (probability between 0.5 and 1)
- Certain (probability = 1)

### Simple Events

Working with single outcomes:

- Probability of simple events
- Complementary events: $P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(\text{A})$
- Mutually exclusive events

**Example:** If the probability of rain is 0.3, what is the probability it won't rain?

Solution: $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$

### Tree Diagrams

Visualizing probability:

- Representing outcomes systematically
- Calculating probabilities of multiple events
- Understanding combined events

### Probability in Games

Understanding fairness and strategy:

- Fair vs. unfair games
- Expected outcomes
- Making predictions

**Example:** In a game where you win if you roll a 5 or 6, the probability of winning is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

## Practice Problems

1. What is the probability of rolling an even number on a standard die?
2. A bag contains 5 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability of drawing a blue ball?
3. If $P(\text{event}) = 0.65$, find $P(\text{not event})$
4. You flip a coin twice. What is the probability of getting two heads?

## Real-World Applications

- Weather forecasting
- Sports predictions
- Insurance calculations
- Game design
- Risk assessment
