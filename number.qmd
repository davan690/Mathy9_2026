## Lesson notes and practice

### Week 1 Thu - Unit launch, number line warm-up, baseline check

**Notes**

- Review integer placement on a number line and compare values using <, >, and =.
- Emphasize direction: right is greater, left is smaller.
- Baseline check focuses on place value and simple operations.

**Worked examples**

1. Place and compare: $-3$ and $2$.
	- $-3$ is left of $2$, so $-3 < 2$.
2. Distance from zero: compare $-7$ and $5$.
	- $|-7| = 7$ and $|5| = 5$, so $-7$ is further from zero.
3. Order these: $4, -1, 0, -5$.
	- $-5, -1, 0, 4$.
