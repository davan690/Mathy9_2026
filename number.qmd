## Introduction

Number and operations form the foundation of mathematics. In this unit, we'll develop fluency with different types of numbers and operations.

## Key Topics

### Integers

Working with positive and negative numbers:

- Understanding the number line
- Adding and subtracting integers
- Multiplying and dividing integers
- Real-world applications of negative numbers

**Example:** If the temperature is -3°C and it rises by 7°C, what is the new temperature?

Solution: -3 + 7 = 4°C

### Fractions

Operations with fractions:

- Equivalent fractions
- Adding and subtracting fractions
- Multiplying and dividing fractions
- Mixed numbers and improper fractions

**Example:** Calculate $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4}$

Solution: $\frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}$

### Decimals

Understanding and using decimal numbers:

- Place value
- Adding and subtracting decimals
- Multiplying and dividing decimals
- Converting between fractions and decimals

**Example:** 3.5 × 0.4 = 1.4

### Percentages

Working with percentages:

- Understanding percentages as fractions of 100
- Converting between percentages, decimals, and fractions
- Finding percentages of amounts
- Percentage increase and decrease

**Example:** What is 15% of 80?

Solution: 15% × 80 = 0.15 × 80 = 12

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate: (-5) + 8 - (-3)
2. Simplify: $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{5}$
3. Find 25% of 160
4. Convert 0.625 to a fraction in simplest form
