## Introduction

Number and operations form the foundation of mathematics. In this unit, we'll develop fluency with different types of numbers and operations.

### Curriculum alignment (Phase 4, Years 9–10)

The summary below draws on the Phase 4 Number table and the Year 9–10 teaching sequences in the resources folder: [resources/NZC - Mathematics and Statistics Phase 4 (Years 9–10).htm](resources/NZC%20-%20Mathematics%20and%20Statistics%20Phase%204%20(Years%209%E2%80%9310).htm), [resources/-Mathematics-and-Statistics-Yr-9-Teaching-Sequence-.pdf](resources/-Mathematics-and-Statistics-Yr-9-Teaching-Sequence-.pdf), [resources/-Mathematics-and-Statistics-Yr-10-Teaching-Sequence-.pdf](resources/-Mathematics-and-Statistics-Yr-10-Teaching-Sequence-.pdf).

| Focus area | Year 9 emphasis | Year 10 emphasis |
|---|---|---|
| Number structures and operations | Scientific notation form; negative exponents; rational numbers between any two numbers; equivalent fractions; number line representations; convert and compare fractions/decimals/percentages; rounding and estimation for reasonableness; order of operations; reciprocals; integer and fraction/decimal operations; negative number equivalence. | Irrational numbers and special symbols; exponent rules; rules for roots and like roots; calculation with scientific notation; exact calculations with fractions, roots, and multiples of $\pi$; significant figures; integer exponents with positive/negative numbers. |
| Rounding, estimation, and precision | Use rounding and estimation to predict results and check reasonableness; round to context. | Use rounding to specified significant figures; apply significant-figure rules in calculations and scientific notation. |
| Percentages, ratios, rates, and proportion | Percentages as fractions of 100; find parts/wholes from percentages; proportional increase/decrease; ratios (part–part, part–whole), rates, and scaling; divide quantities using ratios. | Percentage increase/decrease between two numbers; apply proportional change; compare and use ratios and rates (e.g. speed). |
| Financial mathematics | Apply mark-ups, discounts, simple interest, and GST in context. | Convert currencies; unit-cost/proportion problems; compound interest via repeated simple-interest calculations over short periods. |

**Key vocabulary focus (Phase 4):** GST, index, irrational number, like roots, original amount, precision, rate, reciprocal, recurring, scientific notation, simple interest, compound interest, principal square root, significant figures (see [resources/NZC - Mathematics and Statistics Phase 4 (Years 9–10).htm](resources/NZC%20-%20Mathematics%20and%20Statistics%20Phase%204%20(Years%209%E2%80%9310).htm) and the Year 9–10 teaching sequences).

## Key Topics

### Integers

Working with positive and negative numbers:

- Understanding the number line
- Adding and subtracting integers
- Multiplying and dividing integers
- Real-world applications of negative numbers

**Example:** If the temperature is -3°C and it rises by 7°C, what is the new temperature?

Solution: -3 + 7 = 4°C

### Fractions

Operations with fractions:

- Equivalent fractions
- Adding and subtracting fractions
- Multiplying and dividing fractions
- Mixed numbers and improper fractions

**Example:** Calculate $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4}$

Solution: $\frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}$

### Decimals

Understanding and using decimal numbers:

- Place value
- Adding and subtracting decimals
- Multiplying and dividing decimals
- Converting between fractions and decimals

**Example:** 3.5 × 0.4 = 1.4

### Percentages

Working with percentages:

- Understanding percentages as fractions of 100
- Converting between percentages, decimals, and fractions
- Finding percentages of amounts
- Percentage increase and decrease

**Example:** What is 15% of 80?

Solution: 15% × 80 = 0.15 × 80 = 12

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate: (-5) + 8 - (-3)
2. Simplify: $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{5}$
3. Find 25% of 160
4. Convert 0.625 to a fraction in simplest form
