## Introduction

Measurement involves quantifying attributes of objects and events. We'll learn about different units and how to measure length, area, volume, and other quantities.

## Key Topics

### Units of Measurement

Understanding metric units:

- Length: millimetres (mm), centimetres (cm), metres (m), kilometres (km)
- Mass: grams (g), kilograms (kg), tonnes (t)
- Capacity: millilitres (mL), litres (L)
- Time: seconds, minutes, hours, days

**Example:** Convert 2.5 km to metres.

Solution: 2.5 km = 2.5 × 1000 = 2500 m

### Perimeter

Measuring the distance around shapes:

- Perimeter of rectangles and squares
- Perimeter of triangles and other polygons
- Perimeter of composite shapes

**Example:** Find the perimeter of a rectangle with length 8 cm and width 5 cm.

Solution: Perimeter = 2(8 + 5) = 2(13) = 26 cm

### Area

Measuring the space inside shapes:

- Area of rectangles and squares: $A = l \times w$
- Area of triangles: $A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$
- Area of circles: $A = \pi r^2$
- Area of composite shapes

**Example:** Find the area of a triangle with base 10 cm and height 6 cm.

Solution: $A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 6 = 30 \text{ cm}^2$

### Volume

Measuring the space inside 3D objects:

- Volume of rectangular prisms: $V = l \times w \times h$
- Volume of cubes: $V = s^3$
- Volume of cylinders: $V = \pi r^2 h$
- Capacity and volume relationship

**Example:** Find the volume of a cube with side length 4 cm.

Solution: $V = 4^3 = 64 \text{ cm}^3$

### Surface Area

Measuring the total area of all faces:

- Surface area of rectangular prisms
- Surface area of cubes
- Using nets to find surface area

**Example:** Find the surface area of a cube with side length 3 cm.

Solution: A cube has 6 faces, each with area $3^2 = 9$ cm²

Total surface area = $6 \times 9 = 54$ cm²

### Scale and Maps

Working with scaled representations:

- Understanding scale ratios
- Using scales to find actual distances
- Map reading

**Example:** On a map with scale 1:50000, a distance is 4 cm. What is the actual distance?

Solution: Actual distance = 4 × 50000 = 200000 cm = 2 km

## Practice Problems

1. Convert 3500 mL to litres
2. Find the perimeter of a square with side length 7 cm
3. Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 cm (use π ≈ 3.14)
4. Find the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions 6 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm
