## Introduction

Statistics is about collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data. These skills help us make sense of information and make informed decisions.

## Key Topics

### Data Collection

Methods of gathering information:

- Surveys and questionnaires
- Observations
- Experiments
- Sampling methods
- Primary vs. secondary data

**Example:** To find out students' favorite sports, we could conduct a survey of the class.

### Organizing Data

Ways to arrange and present data:

- Frequency tables
- Tally charts
- Grouping data into intervals
- Creating categories

**Example:** Tally chart of favorite colors in class

### Displaying Data

Visual representations of data:

- Bar graphs and column graphs
- Line graphs
- Pie charts
- Pictographs
- Dot plots
- Stem-and-leaf plots

**Example:** A bar graph showing the number of students who prefer different subjects.

### Measures of Central Tendency

Finding typical or middle values:

- **Mean**: The average of all values
  - Formula: Sum of all values ÷ Number of values
- **Median**: The middle value when data is ordered
- **Mode**: The most frequent value

**Example:** Find the mean of: 4, 7, 5, 9, 5

Solution: Mean = (4 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 5) ÷ 5 = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

### Range and Spread

Understanding how data varies:

- Range: Maximum value - Minimum value
- Quartiles and interquartile range
- Outliers (unusual values)

**Example:** For the data set 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, the range is 11 - 3 = 8

### Interpreting Data

Making sense of statistical information:

- Reading and understanding graphs
- Drawing conclusions from data
- Identifying trends and patterns
- Understanding bias and misleading graphs

### Box-and-Whisker Plots

Visualizing the distribution of data:

- Five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum)
- Identifying the spread of data
- Comparing data sets

## Practice Problems

1. Find the mean, median, and mode of: 12, 15, 11, 15, 18, 13
2. Calculate the range of the data: 23, 45, 32, 51, 28, 36
3. Create a frequency table for the following ages: 13, 14, 13, 15, 14, 13, 14, 15, 13
4. Draw a bar graph showing: Apples-5, Oranges-8, Bananas-6, Grapes-3

## Real-World Applications

- Analyzing sports statistics
- Understanding weather patterns
- Interpreting survey results
- Making data-driven decisions
