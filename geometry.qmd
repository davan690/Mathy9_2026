## Introduction

Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects. In Year 9, we'll explore properties of 2D and 3D shapes, angles, and transformations.

## Key Topics

### Angles

Understanding and measuring angles:

- Types of angles (acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex)
- Angles on a straight line (sum to 180°)
- Angles around a point (sum to 360°)
- Vertically opposite angles
- Corresponding, alternate, and co-interior angles

**Example:** If two angles on a straight line are $x$ and $2x$, find their values.

Solution: $x + 2x = 180°$, so $3x = 180°$, therefore $x = 60°$

### Triangles

Properties of triangles:

- Types of triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)
- Angle sum of a triangle (180°)
- Exterior angles of triangles
- Congruent triangles

**Example:** In a triangle, two angles are 65° and 45°. Find the third angle.

Solution: $180° - 65° - 45° = 70°$

### Quadrilaterals

Properties of four-sided shapes:

- Squares, rectangles, parallelograms
- Rhombus, trapezium, kite
- Angle properties
- Symmetry properties

### Circles

Understanding circles:

- Parts of a circle (radius, diameter, chord, arc)
- Circumference and area
- Relationship between radius and diameter

**Example:** If a circle has a radius of 5 cm, find its diameter.

Solution: Diameter = 2 × radius = 2 × 5 = 10 cm

### Transformations

Moving and changing shapes:

- Translation (sliding)
- Reflection (flipping)
- Rotation (turning)
- Enlargement (scaling)

### 3D Shapes

Exploring three-dimensional objects:

- Prisms and pyramids
- Faces, edges, and vertices
- Nets of 3D shapes

## Practice Problems

1. Find the missing angle in a triangle with angles 42° and 68°
2. Calculate the angles on a straight line if one angle is three times the other
3. Name the quadrilateral with all sides equal and all angles 90°
4. Find the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm (use π ≈ 3.14)
