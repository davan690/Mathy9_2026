Ānō me he whare pūngāwerewere. 
Behold, it is like the web of a spider. 
 
This whakataukī celebrates intricacy, complexity, 
interconnectedness, and strength. The Learning Area of 
Mathematics and Statistics weaves together the effort 
and creativity of many cultures that over time have used 
mathematical and statistical ideas to understand their 
world.
 
The Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area equips students with conceptual and procedural knowledge that 
empowers them to explore and make sense of the world. Mathematics and Statistics allows students to appreciate and 
draw on the power of abstraction, visualisation, and symbolic representation to connect new knowledge to their current 
understandings of quantity, space, time, data, and uncertainty. Students are taught logical reasoning and critical thinking 
skills that help them to evaluate information, question assumptions, and express ideas clearly. 
Through the study of mathematical and statistical reasoning, students learn how to differentiate what is probable from 
what is possible and draw reliable conclusions about what is reasonable. As students are taught to notice patterns and 
variation, select approaches, draw conclusions, and justify their solutions, they build confidence in their mathematical and 
statistical abilities and problem-solving skills, applying these to new contexts. 
The Mathematics and Statistics Learning Area provides students with concepts and tools to investigate, represent, and 
connect situations, as well as to generalise, explain, and justify their findings. Students learn that Mathematics and 
Statistics is a creative discipline that sparks curiosity and wonder and that it has been shaped by the contributions of 
diverse people and cultures over time. 
As students progress through the Learning Area, they deepen their understanding of how to use mathematics and 
statistics accurately, efficiently, and confidently in increasingly complex ways. They are encouraged to engage with 
important societal issues — such as ethically gathering, interpreting, and communicating data — and to observe and 
describe similarities, patterns, and trends across natural, technological, and social contexts.

Mathematics and Statistics Year 10 | October 2025 Page 4 
 
The year-by-year teaching sequences for Mathematics and Statistics lay out the knowledge and practices to be taught 
each year. The teaching sequences for Years 0–10 are organised into six strands: Number, Algebra, Measurement, 
Geometry, Statistics, and Probability. 
Number focuses on numerical concepts and systems. It develops students’ understanding of how numbers are used to 
represent quantities, estimate, measure, and perform calculations, and how number systems have evolved to meet 
practical and social needs. 
Algebra focuses on generalisation and mathematical reasoning. It develops students’ understanding of how patterns and 
relationships can be represented using symbols, graphs, and diagrams, and how algebraic thinking supports problem 
solving and communication. 
Measurement focuses on quantifying phenomena using units and systems. It develops students’ understanding of how 
to measure tangible and intangible quantities using standard and non-standard units, and how measurement systems 
vary across cultures and contexts. 
Geometry focuses on shape, space, and transformation. It develops students’ understanding of how to visualise, 
represent, and reason about objects and their position, orientation, and movement, drawing on geometric ideas used 
across cultures and in the natural world. 
Statistics focuses on data and uncertainty. It develops students’ understanding of how to collect, organise, and interpret 
data in context, and how statistical thinking supports informed decision making. 
Probability focuses on chance and likelihood. It develops students’ understanding of how to quantify uncertainty, make 
predictions, and evaluate the likelihood of events, supporting probabilistic reasoning in everyday and applied contexts. 
The year-by-year teaching sequences, organised through strands and elements, set out what is to be taught. Their 
enactment is shaped by teachers, who design learning in response to their learners, adjusting the order and emphasis, 
and adding contexts and content as appropriate.

Across Years 0–10, Mathematics and Statistics takes students on a journey of increasingly sophisticated thinking about 
number, patterns, space, and data. Through purposeful exploration and practice, students build the knowledge and 
fluency they need to solve problems, reason logically, and make sense of the world around them. 
The mathematical and statistical processes of investigating, representing and connecting situations, and generalising, 
explaining, and justifying findings are fundamental to all mathematical and statistical teaching and underpin the way 
students gain understanding of the knowledge and practices being taught.  
Years 0–3 
In Years 0–3, teaching focuses on building students’ ability to investigate, classify, and describe quantities, shapes, and 
data. Teachers draw attention to properties of numbers and attributes of shapes.  Materials and pictures support 
visualisation of these numerical and geometric concepts. Explicit teaching enables students to make connections 
between representations and to develop their reasoning. 
Years 4–6 
In Years 4–6, teaching focuses on students’ use of a variety of representations to model number operations and to solve 
word problems. They extend their understanding of whole numbers to fractions and decimals, and they visualise, classify, 
and draw angles using benchmarks to support and justify their classifications. Students apply their knowledge of number 
operations to reasoning about measurements and to investigating variations in patterns, shapes, probabilities, and data. 
They begin to work with exponents, can tell the time, and convert between units of time. 
Years 7–8 
In Years 7 and 8, teaching focuses on students’ use of logic and reasoning to identify, clarify, and solve problems, make 
connections between mathematical and statistical concepts, and investigate patterns and variation. They use appropriate 
conventions, vocabulary, and algebraic notation to clearly explain solutions and justify their approaches to solving 
problems. Students select, use, and adapt representations to visualise and extend their reasoning (e.g. number lines to 
represent integers, and equations to represent linear patterns). They make generalisations, identify and calculate 
unknown quantities (e.g. the size of angles), and use data visualisations to evaluate claims and make conjectures. They 
begin to explore irrational numbers and to operate fluently with integers. 
Years 9–10 
In Years 9 and 10, teaching focuses on students’ use of proportional reasoning to transform numerical quantities, 
measurements, and shapes, including right-angled triangles. They begin to generalise their understanding and 
application of tables, equations, and graphs, including to explore patterns and the connections between different 
representations. They extend their understanding of area, perimeter, and volume for a variety of 2D shapes, including 
circles, and 3D shapes, including prisms. They use data visualisations to investigate, represent, and explain patterns, 
trends, and variation, and they apply their knowledge to situations involving chance. 
 
The Mathematics and Statistics learning area prepares students with the knowledge and practices they need to access 
related curriculum subjects in Years 11–13, such as Statistics, Mathematics, and Physics.

Practices 
The skills, strategies, and applications to teach. 
Number 
structures and 
operations 
 Non-repeating, infinite decimals are irrational 
numbers; some of them are represented by special 
symbols, such as √2 and 𝜋. 
 The terms index, power, and exponent are used 
interchangeably. 
 For the number 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎 represents the base, and 𝑛 
represents the exponent. 
 Exponent rules govern how operations involving 
exponents work and include: 
o 𝑎𝑚 × 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑚+𝑛 (the product-of-exponents rule) 
o 
𝑎𝑚
𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑚−𝑛 (the quotient-of-exponents rule) 
o (𝑎𝑚)𝑛 = 𝑎𝑚×𝑛 (the exponent-of-exponents rule) 
o 𝑎−𝑚 =
1
𝑎𝑚 , (𝑎 ≠ 0) (the negative exponent rule) 
o 𝑎0 = 1 (𝑎 ≠ 0) (the zero exponent rule). 
 Only like roots can be added and subtracted; 
multiples of a root are represented with coefficients 
(e.g. √3 + √3 = 2√3). 
 There are rules for working with roots, including not 
leaving roots in a denominator: 
o √𝑎 × √𝑎 = 𝑎 
o √𝑎 × √𝑏 = √𝑎𝑏 
o √𝑎 ÷ √𝑎 = 1 
o √𝑎 ÷ √𝑏 = √
𝑎
𝑏 = √𝑎
√𝑏 × √𝑏
√𝑏 = √𝑎𝑏
𝑏 . 
 Identifying, reading, writing, representing, 
comparing, ordering, and converting between 
fractions, decimals, and percentages 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Recording, comparing, ordering, and calculating 
with numbers in scientific notation 
 Identifying irrational numbers (e.g. √10
3
, 𝜋) 
 Generalising about whether square and cube roots 
of whole numbers are rational or irrational 
 Calculating using integer exponents 
 Calculating exactly using fractions, roots, and 
multiples of 𝜋 
 The rules for identifying significant figures are: 
o all non-zero digits are significant 
o zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero 
digits are significant 
o leading zeros are not significant 
o trailing zeros are significant if there is a decimal 
point present, and are not significant otherwise 
o exact numbers have an unlimited number of 
significant figures. 
 For numbers written in scientific notation as 𝑎 × 10𝑘, 
the number of significant figures is determined by 
applying the rules to the value of 𝑎. 
 Using rounding, including to specified significant 
figures, and estimation to predict results and to 
check the reasonableness of calculations 
 Rounding to the degree of precision required for the 
context 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 The order of operations is important when 
evaluating or forming expressions. Operations are 
done as follows: 
1. grouped operations (e.g. expressions under a 
square root, involving the numerator of a 
fraction, or inside brackets) 
2. exponents or powers 
3. multiplication and division, from left to right 
4. addition and subtraction, from left to right. 
 Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing 
positive and negative numbers, including fractions 
and decimals 
 Evaluating positive integer exponents for positive 
and negative numbers (e.g. 35, (−1)4)

Practices 
The skills, strategies, and applications to teach. 
 A mnemonic, such as GEMA — Grouped 
(e.g. √32  +  42 ), Exponents (e.g.(−2)3), 
Multiplicative (× and ÷), Additive (+ and −) — can 
be used to remember the order of operations. 
 Every non-zero number has a multiplicative inverse 
(reciprocal), and their product is 1 (e.g. 5 and 
1
5 are 
reciprocals, so 5 ×
1
5 =
1
5 × 5 = 1). 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Percentages are a way of expressing a fraction of 
100. 
 Percentages can be used to proportionally increase 
or decrease a quantity by multiplication and can be 
presented as decimal multipliers. 
o A percentage increase can be described by the 
additional percentage or the percentage of the 
final amount compared to the original amount 
(e.g. a 20% increase represents 120% of the 
original amount). 
o A percentage decrease can be described by the 
percentage lost or the percentage of the final 
amount compared to the original amount (e.g. a 
20% decrease represents 80% of the original 
amount). 
 Ratios show part-to-part or part-to-whole 
comparisons of two or more quantities. 
 Ratios can be scaled up or down or simplified. 
 A rate proportionally compares two quantities that 
have different units of measure; when working with 
rates, ‘per’ means ‘for every’ in day-to-day contexts. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Finding a fraction or percentage of a number 
 Finding the whole amount, given a fraction or 
percentage (e.g. 20% of an amount is 30. What is 
the original amount?) 
 Expressing a number as a fraction or percentage of 
another number 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Applying a proportional increase or decrease to a 
number 
 Calculating the percentage increase or decrease 
between two numbers (e.g. What is the percentage 
increase between 50 and 75?) 
 Comparing and using ratios and rate (e.g. finding 
speed, given distance and time) 
Financial 
mathematics 
 Percentages, ratios, rates, and proportions are often 
applied in financial situations. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Converting New Zealand dollars into other 
currencies, and vice versa 
 Finding proportions of costs (e.g. the price of 400 g 
of an item, given the cost per kilogram) 
 Calculating compound interest on dollar amounts, 
by calculating simple interest month by month for 
short time periods (e.g. How much do you have 
after 3 months if you invest $100 at a 2.5%-per-
month interest rate?)

 When operating on or writing equations with 
fractions, fractions of magnitude greater than 1 are 
usually written as improper fractions. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
o collecting like terms 
o factorising using common factors 
o factorising quadratic expressions with a leading 
coefficient of 1 
o expanding products, including multiplying a single 
term by a bracketed term, and multiplying two 
expressions each of the form 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏, where 𝑎 and 
𝑏 are integers 
o factorising by grouping (i.e. using the distributive 
law) (e.g. 𝑥2 + 2𝑥 − 8 = 𝑥2 + 4𝑥 − 2𝑥 − 8 =
𝑥(𝑥 + 4) − 2(𝑥 + 4) = (𝑥 − 2)(𝑥 + 4)) 
 Forming and solving linear equations and linear 
inequalities with rational number coefficients 
(e.g. −
2
5  𝑥 + 5 ≤ −10), giving exact or rounded 
solutions, and representing the solution on a 
number line 
 Solving quadratic equations that are factorised or of 
the form 𝑥2 + 𝑐 = 0 (where 𝑐 is an integer), and 
connecting the solutions to the 𝑥-intercepts of the 
related graph 
 Substituting into, rearranging, and simplifying 
expressions or formulae that involve squares or 
square roots (e.g. 𝐴 = 𝜋𝑟2,  𝑐2 = 𝑎2 + 𝑏2) 
 Multiplying or dividing by a negative number 
reverses an inequality. 
 The constant rate of change of a linear graph is the 
vertical change (how far it goes up or down) divided 
by the horizontal change (how far it moves 
sideways). 
 Finding square roots of numbers and solving 
quadratic equations are related but have some 
differences. 
o Any positive real number has two square roots: 
one positive (the principal square root) and one 
negative (e.g. for 16, 4 and -4). 
o The square root operation √  refers specifically 
to the principal square root (e.g. √16 = 4). 
o There are 0, 1, or 2 real-number solutions to 𝑥2 =
𝑎, where 𝑎 is a number. 
 The zero product property states that if two 
expressions multiply to be zero, then at least one 
expression must be zero (e.g. if  𝑎𝑏 =
0 then either 𝑎 or 𝑏 is 0, or if  (𝑥 − 𝑎)(𝑥 − 𝑏) = 0 then 
either (𝑥 − 𝑎) = 0 or  (𝑥 − 𝑏) = 0).  
 There are specific factorising relationships that are 
useful to recognise: 
o 𝑥(𝑥 + 𝑎) = 𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑥 
o difference of two squares: (𝑥 + 𝑎)(𝑥 − 𝑎) = 𝑥2 −
𝑎2 
o square of a sum: (𝑥 + 𝑎)2 = 𝑥2 + 2𝑎𝑥 + 𝑎2 
o square of a difference: (𝑥 − 𝑎)2 = 𝑥2 − 2𝑎𝑥 + 𝑎2. 
 The solution to a linear inequality is a set of values 
which may be represented with a number line. 
 For a specific straight line, the gradient, 𝑚, and 𝑦-
intercept, 𝑐, are fixed, and 𝑥 varies with 𝑦 according 
to the rule 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+ 𝑐. 
 The 𝑦-intercept touches the 𝑦 −axis and has 
coordinates (0, 𝑐). 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Interpreting and graphing linear equations in the 
form 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+ 𝑐, using the gradient and 𝑦-intercept 
  Calculating the gradient and 𝑦 −intercept of a line, 
using a graph 
 Comparing the relative magnitude of 𝑚 in two or 
more linear graphs, using the concept of steepness 
and relating it to the magnitude of 𝑚 
 Finding the equation of a line, given two points or 
the gradient and a single point  
 Determining the effect on graphs in the coordinate 
plane of changing the coefficient of 𝑥2 and the fixed 
value c, for a range of quadratic equations of the 
form 𝑦 =  𝑎𝑥2 or 𝑦 =  𝑥2  +  𝑐, where a is a positive 
integer and c is an integer 
 The gradient 𝑚 of a straight line can be determined 
with the formula 𝑚 =
𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑒
𝑟𝑢𝑛 =
𝛥𝑦
𝛥𝑥. 
 A vertical line has an infinite gradient. This cannot 
be expressed in the formula 𝑚 =
𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑒
𝑟𝑢𝑛 as it becomes 
𝑚 =
𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑒
0 , which cannot be evaluated. 
 The equation of a vertical line is 𝑥 = 𝑏, where the 𝑥-
intercept is (𝑏, 0).

Practices 
The skills, strategies, and applications to teach. 
Measuring  A solution to a calculation cannot be more precise 
than the least precise number used in that 
calculation. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Estimating, calculating, converting, and accurately 
representing measurements using significant figures 
 The number of significant figures in a measurement 
is the number of digits that contribute to the degree 
of accuracy of the measurement, given as the 
number of digits known with certainty plus one 
uncertain digit. 
 When calculating, it is best to use at least one more 
significant figure than is required in the final 
solution, and round at the end of the whole 
calculation. 
 Conversions between different-sized metric units 
may be needed to give the appropriate units for a 
measurement or calculation. 
 The metric prefixes ‘kilo–’, ‘mega–’, ‘giga–’, and 
‘tera–’ signify a unit that is one thousand, one 
million, one billion, and one trillion times larger than 
the base unit. 
 The metric prefixes ‘centi–’, ‘milli–’, ‘micro–’, and 
‘nano–’ signify a unit one hundredth, one 
thousandth, one millionth, and one billionth the size 
of the base unit. 
 Derived units (e.g. cm2, km/h) reflect a relationship 
— a product or quotient — between two different 
measurements. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Converting between metric units, and using the 
appropriate prefixes in the metric system (e.g. kilo–, 
mega–, centi–, milli–, micro–) 
 The area of a circle is given by A = 𝜋𝑟2. 
 The surface area of a solid object is a measure of 
the total area that the surface of the object

 Calculating the surface area of cubes, rectangular 
prisms, triangular prisms, cylinders, and composite 
figures 
 Calculating the volume of cylinders and irregular 
prisms with a consistent cross-sectional area 
 Resizing (enlarging or reducing) a shape changes 
its perimeter, area, or volume proportionally 
according to the dimensions of the units; linear 
metric conversions must be squared to convert area 
and cubed to convert volume. 
 Scaling a shape by a factor, and determining the 
scale factor for the scaled shape’s area or volume

 For right-angled triangles, Pythagoras’ theorem 
states that the square of the hypotenuse (longest 
side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other 
two sides. 
 If (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) is a Pythagorean triple, then so is 
(𝑘𝑎, 𝑘𝑏, 𝑘𝑐), where 𝑘 is a positive integer. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Using Pythagoras’ theorem to: 
o find the length of an unknown side in a right-
angled triangle 
o check if a triangle has a right angle 
o calculate the distance between two points in the 
coordinate plane, yielding the distance formula 
𝑑 = √(𝑥2 − 𝑥1)2 + (𝑦2 − 𝑦1)2 
 There is a fixed relationship between speed,

This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Finding speed, distance, or time, given any two of

Developing 
knowledge 
from data 
 It is not always possible to get data from the entire 
population (as in a census). To make inferences 
about a population without a census, sampling is 
used. 
 Samples must be taken randomly from the 
population, otherwise there will be bias in the data, 
leading to inaccurate and misleading statistics. 
Samples are ideally chosen using simple random 
 Planning and collecting multivariate data to respond 
to a statistical question using a sample or census

sampling, in which each item of the population has 
an equal probability of being chosen. 
 When sampling from a population, the distribution 
for a variable varies from sample to sample. To 
make a reliable inference about what is happening 
in the population, sample sizes need to be: 
o about 1,000 for categorical variables (with the 
sample obtained using technology) 
o at least 30 for numerical variables. 
Visualisation 
of data 
 A distribution is formed from all the possible values 
of a variable and their frequencies. It can be shown 
using data visualisations that show patterns, trends, 
and variations and that include dot plots, bar 
graphs, frequency tables, box plots, histograms, 
time-series graphs, scatter plots, and two-way 
tables. 
 A good data visualisation should allow viewers to 
discern the variable(s) and who the data was 
collected from, and then, depending on the type of 
visualisation, additional information such as 
frequency, proportions, patterns or trends, and units 
for numerical variables. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Creating multiple data visualisations for an 
investigation 
 Selecting appropriate scales for data 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 In relationship investigations: 
o sometimes one variable is thought of as 
predictive of the other variable; then the response 
or dependent variable is on the 𝑦-axis, and the 
‘predictive’, explanatory, or independent variable 
is on the 𝑥-axis 
o an eyeballed line or curve of best fit can be added 
for paired numerical data. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 For relationship investigations, drawing an 
eyeballed line or curve of best fit to predict possible 
𝑦-values (the response variable) for given 𝑥-values 
(the explanatory variable) 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
Interpretation 
of data 
 Elements of chance affect the certainty of results 
from observational studies and experiments. 
 Uncertainty should be taken into account when 
making claims. 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Critically considering data visualisations, including 
those from contemporary media, to see if they 
support or misrepresent the data 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 To compare data on the same variable from two 
groups in the same population, the 75%-to-50% 
comparison rule for informal inferences is used. If 
the groups are called A and B, and If more than 
50% of group B’s data is larger than 75% of group 
A’s data, then we can make the claim that B tends 
to be larger than A back in the population. 
 An interpolation involves making predictions within 
the range of a numerical data variable. 
 An extrapolation involves making predictions 
outside the range of a numerical data variable. 
 Communicating findings in context to answer an 
investigative question, using evidence and with an 
awareness of variability 
 Making an informal inference in comparative 
situations about what might be happening in the 
population, based on visual considerations and 
using the 75%-to-50% comparison rule 
 Making informal predictions from scatter plots in 
relationship situations

Practices 
The skills, strategies, and applications to teach. 
Experimental 
and theoretical 
probability 
 Some chance-based situations, such as tossing a 
non-regular 3D shape, can only be explored through 
probability experiments. 
 Results from sets of repeated trials for the same 
experiment may vary. 
 The Law of Large Numbers states that as the 
number of trials in a chance experiment increases, 
the experimental probability will approach the 
experiment’s theoretical probability. 
 Lists, tables, two-way tables, and tree diagrams are 
useful systematic methods for generating all 
possible outcomes. 
 In joint events, events can be dependent or 
independent. 
 Probabilities for joint events cannot simply be 
added, because doing so would double-count 
outcomes that are common to both events. 
 Mutually exclusive events cannot occur together. 
 The estimated probability of an event from an 
experiment is the number of times the event 
happens divided by the total number of trials in the 
experiment (i.e. the relative frequency for that 
event). 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10. 
 Carrying out a chance experiment, including running 
simulations for a large number of trials using digital 
tools 
 Systematically listing outcomes for the sample 
space 
 Comparing experimental probability (from at least 
30 trials) to theoretical probability for a chance 
experiment, and explaining why they differ and how 
increasing the number of trials reduces this 
difference 
 Carrying out chance experiments of at least 100 
trials and comparing the experimental probability of 
each individual outcome to its theoretical probability, 
in order to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers 
 Creating and describing data visualisations for the 
distribution of observed outcomes from a chance 
experiment  
 Calculating probability estimates for different 
outcomes 
This content is to be taught across Years 9 and 10.
