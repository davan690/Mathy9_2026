## Introduction

Ratios and proportions describe relationships between quantities. They are fundamental to understanding scaling, comparison, and many real-world applications.

## Key Topics

### Understanding Ratios

Comparing quantities:

- Ratios show the relationship between two or more quantities
- Written as a:b or $\frac{a}{b}$
- Simplifying ratios to simplest form
- Part-to-part vs. part-to-whole ratios

**Example:** If there are 12 boys and 8 girls in a class, the ratio of boys to girls is 12:8 = 3:2

### Equivalent Ratios

Finding equal ratios:

- Multiplying or dividing both parts by the same number
- Using ratio tables
- Scaling up and down

**Example:** The ratio 4:6 is equivalent to 2:3 (dividing by 2) or 8:12 (multiplying by 2)

### Proportions

When ratios are equal:

- A proportion is an equation showing two ratios are equal
- Cross multiplication to solve proportions
- Direct proportion relationships

**Example:** Solve: $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{x}{15}$

Solution: $5x = 3 \times 15$, so $5x = 45$, therefore $x = 9$

### Sharing in Ratios

Dividing quantities according to ratios:

- Dividing amounts into given ratios
- Finding total parts
- Calculating each share

**Example:** Share $60 in the ratio 2:3

Solution: Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5

First share = $\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = $24$

Second share = $\frac{3}{5} \times 60 = $36$

### Rates

Special ratios comparing different units:

- Speed (distance per time)
- Unit rates (per 1 unit)
- Price per item
- Comparing rates

**Example:** If you travel 180 km in 3 hours, your speed is:

$\text{Speed} = \frac{180 \text{ km}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ km/h}$

### Scale Factors

Ratios in enlargement and reduction:

- Scale drawings
- Maps and models
- Enlargement and reduction
- Similar shapes

**Example:** A model car has a scale of 1:24. If the model is 15 cm long, what is the actual car length?

Solution: Actual length = 15 × 24 = 360 cm = 3.6 m

### Direct Proportion

When quantities increase together:

- If one doubles, the other doubles
- Graphing direct proportion (straight line through origin)
- Formula: $y = kx$ where k is constant

**Example:** If 3 pens cost $6, how much do 7 pens cost?

Solution: Cost is proportional to number of pens

$\frac{3}{6} = \frac{7}{x}$, so $3x = 42$, therefore $x = 14$ ($14)

### Percentages as Ratios

Connecting percentages to ratios:

- Percentages are ratios out of 100
- Converting between percentages and ratios
- Percentage increase and decrease

## Practice Problems

1. Simplify the ratio 24:36
2. If the ratio of cats to dogs is 5:3 and there are 15 cats, how many dogs are there?
3. Share $120 in the ratio 3:5
4. A car travels 250 km in 5 hours. What is its average speed?
5. On a map with scale 1:25000, two towns are 8 cm apart. What is the actual distance?

## Real-World Applications

- Cooking and recipes
- Currency exchange
- Scale models and maps
- Mixing paint or chemicals
- Financial planning
- Construction and design
