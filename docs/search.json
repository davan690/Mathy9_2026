If the model is 15 cm long, what is the actual car length?\nSolution: Actual length = 15 × 24 = 360 cm = 3.6 m\n\n\nDirect Proportion\nWhen quantities increase together:\n\nIf one doubles, the other doubles\nGraphing direct proportion (straight line through origin)\nFormula: \\(y = kx\\) where k is constant\n\nExample: If 3 pens cost $6, how much do 7 pens cost?\nSolution: Cost is proportional to number of pens\n\\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{7}{x}\\), so \\(3x = 42\\), therefore \\(x = 14\\) ($14)\n\n\nPercentages as Ratios\nConnecting percentages to ratios:\n\nPercentages are ratios out of 100\nConverting between percentages and ratios\nPercentage increase and decrease"
