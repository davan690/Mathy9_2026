Find the third angle.\nSolution: \\(180° - 65° - 45° = 70°\\)\n\n\nQuadrilaterals\nProperties of four-sided shapes:\n\nSquares, rectangles, parallelograms\nRhombus, trapezium, kite\nAngle properties\nSymmetry properties\n\n\n\nCircles\nUnderstanding circles:\n\nParts of a circle (radius, diameter, chord, arc)\nCircumference and area\nRelationship between radius and diameter\n\nExample: If a circle has a radius of 5 cm, find its diameter.\nSolution: Diameter = 2 × radius = 2 × 5 = 10 cm\n\n\nTransformations\nMoving and changing shapes:\n\nTranslation (sliding)\nReflection (flipping)\nRotation (turning)\nEnlargement (scaling)\n\n\n\n3D Shapes\nExploring three-dimensional objects:\n\nPrisms and pyramids\nFaces, edges, and vertices\nNets of 3D shapes"
